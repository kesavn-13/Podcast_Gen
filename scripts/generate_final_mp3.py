                    {"speaker": "host1", "text": "The main issue was sequential computation. RNNs process tokens one by one, making parallelization impossible."},
                    {"speaker": "host2", "text": "This made training incredibly slow, especially on long sequences. Plus vanishing gradients were a constant problem."},
