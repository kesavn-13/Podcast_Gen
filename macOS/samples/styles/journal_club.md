## Example Exchange
**Host 1**: "Let's examine the methodology. They used a randomized controlled design with 500 participants, which gives us good statistical power."

**Host 2**: "Agreed. The sample size calculation on page 4 shows they were appropriately powered to detect a medium effect size. However, I'm curious about the exclusion criteria."

**Host 1**: "Good point. They excluded participants with comorbidities, which might limit generalizability to real-world populations."

**Host 2**: "Exactly. While this increases internal validity, it raises questions about external validity that we should discuss..."
