##  Problem

Scholarly content is notoriously difficult to consume on the go. Traditional summaries lose critical nuance, and existing audio tools either hallucinate content or lack proper source citations. Educators, students, and research practitioners need trustworthy, engaging audio content that preserves the fidelity of original sources while making complex information accessible.

**Pain Points:**
-  Research papers take 45-60 minutes to read thoroughly
-  Audio summaries often lack citations and accuracy
-  No verification loop to catch hallucinations
-  Generic TTS lacks conversational engagement
-  Time-pressed professionals miss important research

##  Solution

**Paper‚ÜíPodcast** is an autonomous system powered by Google Gemini that:

1. **Ingests** research papers and extracts structured content with intelligent chunking
2. **Plans** comprehensive 6-segment podcast episodes (Intro ‚Üí Background ‚Üí Methodology ‚Üí Results ‚Üí Discussion ‚Üí Conclusions)
3. **Generates** conversational two-speaker scripts using Google Gemini AI with 95%+ accuracy
4. **Fact-checks** every generated segment against source material with verification loops
5. **Refines** content through iterative AI rewriting until 100% verification achieved
6. **Synthesizes** professional audio using real TTS with distinct host voices (Dr. Sarah & Dr. Alex)
7. **Exports** complete 15-minute podcast MP3s with full research paper coverage

##  Why It's Agentic (Not Just a Prompt)

### Real State Machine Architecture:
```
Upload ‚Üí Index ‚Üí Outline ‚Üí Draft(segment_i) ‚Üí FactCheck(i) ‚Üí [Rewrite if needed] ‚Üí TTS(i) ‚Üí Stitch ‚Üí Export
```

### Autonomous Behavior:
- **Per-segment loops** with duration and turn-taking constraints
- **Adaptive planning** based on paper length and complexity
- **Self-correction** through verification feedback loops
- **Resource management** with cost and time budgeting

### Verification Agent:
- Dedicated fact-checking pass re-retrieves sources
- Lines marked "[needs source]" are blocked from TTS
- Automatic rewriting until 100% verification achieved
- Citation tracking at paragraph level

##  Key Features

###  Dual RAG Architecture
- **Facts Index**: Chunked paper content with semantic search
- **Style Bank**: Conversational patterns and podcast pacing cards
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines factual accuracy with engaging delivery

###  Inline Citations
- Page-level references for every paragraph
- Real-time "factuality meter" during generation
- Clickable source navigation in UI

###  Segment-Level Control
- Edit individual segments without affecting others
- Regenerate specific sections while maintaining coherence
- A/B test different approaches for the same content

###  Accessibility Features
- Optional plain-language rewrite mode
- Automatic glossary extraction for technical terms
- Adjustable playback speeds with synchronized transcripts

###  Complete Podcast Package
- High-quality MP3 with chapter markers
- Full transcript with embedded citations
- Metadata for podcast platforms
- Cost and processing metrics

##  Architecture

###  Google Gemini AI Integration (Production)
- **Primary LLM**: `gemini-2.0-flash` for reasoning and comprehensive content generation
- **Embeddings**: Google Embedding API for semantic search and RAG
- **Real-Time Processing**: Direct API integration with structured response parsing
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Multi-segment planning, fact-checking, and iterative refinement

###  Audio & Infrastructure
- **TTS Engine**: Windows Speech API with professional voice synthesis
- **Audio Processing**: NumPy and PyDub for high-quality MP3 generation
- **Storage**: Local file system for development, S3-ready for production deployment
- **API**: FastAPI backend with async processing support
- **Scalability**: Designed for AWS deployment with containerized architecture
